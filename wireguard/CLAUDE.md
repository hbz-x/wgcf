# WireGuard Profile Generation and Key Management

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the `wireguard/` directory, which handles WireGuard profile generation and cryptographic key management for Cloudflare Warp connections.

## Overview

The wireguard package consists of two main components:
- **Key Management** (`keys.go`): Handles cryptographic key generation, validation, and operations
- **Profile Generation** (`profile.go`): Manages WireGuard configuration profile templating and creation

## Key Management System

### Cryptographic Implementation

The key management system is based on the Curve25519 elliptic curve cryptography implementation from WireGuard's reference code:

```go
const KeyLength = 32
type Key [KeyLength]byte
```

#### Key Types and Generation

1. **Private Keys** (`NewPrivateKey()`)
   - Generated using cryptographically secure random bytes
   - Follows WireGuard's key clamping requirements:
     - `k[0] &= 248` - Clears the bottom 3 bits
     - `k[31] = (k[31] & 127) | 64` - Sets specific bits for curve25519
   - These operations ensure the key is a valid scalar for the curve

2. **Public Keys** (`Key.Public()`)
   - Derived from private keys using `curve25519.ScalarBaseMult`
   - Used for peer authentication and key exchange
   - Automatically computed from private keys when needed

3. **Preshared Keys** (`NewPresharedKey()`)
   - Additional symmetric keys for enhanced security
   - Generated using cryptographically secure randomness
   - Optional but recommended for post-quantum resistance

### Security Features

#### Constant-Time Operations
- Uses `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare` for key comparison to prevent timing attacks
- The `IsZero()` method safely checks for zero keys without leaking information

#### Base64 Encoding
- All keys are encoded/decoded using standard Base64 encoding
- The `String()` method provides safe key serialization
- The `NewKey()` function allows reconstruction from Base64 strings

### Key Storage and Configuration

Keys are integrated with the application's configuration system:
- Private keys are stored in the configuration file under the `private_key` field
- Keys persist across application sessions
- The configuration system handles secure storage and retrieval

## Profile Generation System

### Template Structure

The WireGuard profile uses a Go text template system with the following structure:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = {{ .PrivateKey }}
Address = {{ .Address1 }}/32, {{ .Address2 }}/128
DNS = 1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1, 2606:4700:4700::1111, 2606:4700:4700::1001
MTU = 1280

[Peer]
PublicKey = {{ .PublicKey }}
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
Endpoint = {{ .Endpoint }}
```

### Configuration Parameters

The `ProfileData` struct defines the template variables:

- **PrivateKey**: Base64-encoded client private key
- **Address1**: IPv4 address assigned by Cloudflare Warp
- **Address2**: IPv6 address assigned by Cloudflare Warp  
- **PublicKey**: Server's public key for peer authentication
- **Endpoint**: Server endpoint (hostname:port)

### Default Configuration Details

#### Interface Section
- **DNS Servers**: Uses Cloudflare's DNS (1.1.1.1, 1.0.0.1) and IPv6 equivalents
- **MTU**: Set to 1280 bytes to avoid fragmentation issues
- **Address Subnets**: /32 for IPv4 and /128 for IPv6 (single host)

#### Peer Section  
- **AllowedIPs**: Routes all traffic (0.0.0.0/0, ::/0) through the VPN
- **Endpoint**: Dynamically populated from Cloudflare's API response

### Profile Creation Process

1. **Template Parsing**: The profile template is parsed using Go's `text/template`
2. **Data Injection**: ProfileData values are injected into template placeholders
3. **Profile Generation**: The complete WireGuard configuration is generated as a string
4. **File Persistence**: Profiles are saved with restrictive permissions (0600)

## Integration with Cloudflare API

### Registration Flow

When registering a new device (`cmd/register/register.go`):

1. **Key Generation**: A new private key is created or imported
2. **Public Key Derivation**: The corresponding public key is computed
3. **API Registration**: The public key is sent to Cloudflare's registration API
4. **Configuration Storage**: Private key and device credentials are saved locally

### Profile Generation Flow

When generating a profile (`cmd/generate/generate.go`):

1. **Device Query**: Current device configuration is fetched from Cloudflare
2. **Data Extraction**: Server public key, endpoint, and IP addresses are extracted
3. **Profile Assembly**: Local private key is combined with server data
4. **Profile Creation**: Complete WireGuard profile is generated and saved

## Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Strength
- **Curve25519**: Provides ~128-bit security level, resistant to known quantum attacks
- **Key Clamping**: Ensures generated keys are valid curve points
- **Random Generation**: Uses `crypto/rand` for cryptographically secure randomness

### Key Management Security
- **Constant-Time Operations**: Prevents timing-based side-channel attacks
- **Secure Storage**: Configuration files should have restricted permissions
- **No Key Reuse**: Each device registration generates unique keys

### Network Security
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Each WireGuard session uses ephemeral keys
- **Authentication**: Public key cryptography ensures peer authenticity
- **Encryption**: All traffic is encrypted using ChaCha20Poly1305

### Potential Security Concerns
- **Configuration File Access**: Private keys are stored in plaintext configuration files
- **Memory Management**: Keys may remain in memory longer than necessary
- **No Key Rotation**: Keys persist indefinitely without automatic rotation

## Testing Framework

### Key Management Tests (`keys_test.go`)

The test suite validates:
- **Round-trip Encoding**: Keys can be encoded to Base64 and decoded back
- **Deterministic Results**: Same input produces same output
- **Key Format Validation**: Ensures proper Base64 encoding/decoding

### Profile Generation Tests (`profile_test.go`)

The test suite validates:
- **Template Rendering**: Ensures proper variable substitution
- **Output Format**: Validates the generated profile structure
- **Expected Content**: Confirms all required sections are present

### Test Coverage Gaps

Areas that could benefit from additional testing:
- **Key Validation**: Testing invalid keys and error handling
- **Security Properties**: Validating key randomness and uniqueness
- **Edge Cases**: Testing with malformed input data
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end profile generation with real API data

## Modifying Profile Templates

### Template Customization

To modify the WireGuard profile template:

1. **Edit Template String**: Modify the `profileTemplate` variable in `profile.go`
2. **Update ProfileData**: Add new fields to the `ProfileData` struct if needed
3. **Template Syntax**: Use Go template syntax `{{ .FieldName }}` for variables
4. **Validation**: Ensure the output is valid WireGuard configuration format

### Common Modifications

Examples of useful template modifications:

```go
// Add custom DNS servers
DNS = 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

// Enable IPv6 routing only
AllowedIPs = ::/0

// Add preshared key support
[Peer]
PublicKey = {{ .PublicKey }}
PresharedKey = {{ .PresharedKey }}
AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0, ::/0
Endpoint = {{ .Endpoint }}

// Add multiple peers
{{range .Peers}}
[Peer]
PublicKey = {{ .PublicKey }}
Endpoint = {{ .Endpoint }}
AllowedIPs = {{ .AllowedIPs }}
{{end}}
```

### Advanced Templating

The Go template system supports:
- **Conditionals**: `{{if .Field}}...{{end}}`
- **Loops**: `{{range .Array}}...{{end}}`
- **Functions**: Built-in template functions for string manipulation
- **Custom Functions**: Add custom template functions via `template.FuncMap`

## Performance and Optimization

### Key Generation Performance
- Key generation is computationally inexpensive
- Curve25519 operations are optimized in the Go crypto library
- Random number generation is the primary bottleneck

### Profile Generation Performance
- Template parsing occurs on each profile generation
- Consider caching parsed templates for high-frequency generation
- File I/O is the primary performance bottleneck for profile saving

### Memory Considerations
- Keys are small (32 bytes) with minimal memory impact
- Profile strings are typically under 1KB
- Template parsing creates temporary objects that are garbage collected

## Future Enhancements

### Security Improvements
1. **Key Rotation**: Implement automatic key rotation mechanisms
2. **Memory Protection**: Use locked memory regions for sensitive data
3. **Key Derivation**: Support for key derivation from passwords/passphrases
4. **Hardware Security**: Integration with hardware security modules (HSMs)

### Feature Enhancements
1. **Multiple Profiles**: Support for generating multiple profile variants
2. **Profile Validation**: Validate generated profiles against WireGuard specifications
3. **Dynamic Templates**: Support for user-defined profile templates
4. **Configuration Profiles**: Predefined templates for common use cases

### Integration Improvements
1. **API Caching**: Cache Cloudflare API responses to reduce latency
2. **Batch Operations**: Generate multiple profiles in a single operation
3. **Export Formats**: Support additional configuration formats (JSON, YAML)
4. **Import/Export**: Tools for profile backup and migration
